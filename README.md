# 3D Engine in Processing  

This project is a **custom 3D engine** built from scratch in **Processing**, implementing fundamental computer graphics concepts without relying on built-in high-level 3D functions. The engine includes a **complete mathematical projection system**, custom **mesh rendering**, and support for **external 3D model files**, making it a flexible and educational tool for understanding 3D graphics.  

## Features  

- **Custom perspective projection** implemented from scratch  
- **3D mesh rendering** with vertex transformation and camera movement  
- **Compatibility with external 3D file formats** (e.g., OBJ)  
- **Manual implementation of rendering pipeline**, including projection, transformations, and visibility control  
- **Collision detection and real-time interactions**  
- **Optimized performance** for smooth rendering in Processing
